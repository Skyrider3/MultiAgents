System Workflow
1. Paper Selection & Ingestion
o Use 20+ arXiv LaTeX papers in each mathematical domain (e.g., graph
theory).
o Parse abstracts, theorems, and definitions (via MathPix / PDF parsing) to
LaTeX (eval if LaTeX is needed?).
2. Agent Collaboration Phase
o Each agent summarizes their specialty
o Each agent summarizes insights in its “voice.”
o Agents debate implications, note inconsistencies, and propose extensions.
o Coordinator selects promising conjectures and requests peer verification.
3. Output Generation
o Final “MathMind Conjecture Report” with:
▪ 5 conjectures
▪ Evidence trail (citations + logical chain)
▪ Optional: reasoning graph showing agent interactions
