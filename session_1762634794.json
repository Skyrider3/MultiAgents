Theorems related to the asymptotic behavior of polynomials and their roots (see chunk ids [16], [17], [19]) may apply.\n\n2) To prove the conjectures in Sage/Lean or PARI, the following algorithmic steps can be taken:\n   - Define the Alexander polynomial $\\Delta_{p,q}(t)$ for torus knots.\n   - Compute the roots of $\\Delta_{p,q}(t)$ for large values of $p$ and $q$.\n   - Analyze the distribution of these roots on the unit circle.\n   - Calculate the average multiplicity of primitive $r$-th roots of unity among the zeros.\n"
